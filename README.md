# MongoDB $inc Overflow Bug
This repository demonstrates a potential bug in MongoDB update operations when using the `$inc` operator with extremely large numbers, potentially leading to data corruption or unexpected behavior due to integer overflow.

## Bug Description
The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field by a specified value.  However, if an excessively large value is provided, this can cause an integer overflow error. This is not directly a MongoDB bug, but rather a consequence of using the operator incorrectly.

## Solution
The solution involves either using more reasonable values when using `$inc` or better alternative solutions depending on the requirements.  Instead of attempting to increase by a value that might lead to an overflow, smaller increments can be used or other update strategies might be necessary.
